        <h1>Fisher Reese</h1>
             <p>
                I am from Memphis, MO and went to Adair County RII high school in Brashear, MO. <br>
                Some interesting facts about me would be I played basketball, baseball, track, academic bowl, and <br>
                participated in clubs such as FFA, FBLA, NHS. Outside of high school some of my hobbies are working<br>
                on cars, hunting, fishing, and driving a racecar on the weekends.

        <h2>Ranger's Apprentice Series</h2>
            <p>
                This book (and series) is the best I have ever read. The characters are very relatable, <br>
                and are humorous. I would recommend this for anyone, even non-readers, as it had me hooked. <br>
                The Rangers Apprentice Series and Brotherband series are the best books I have ever read, and <br>
                I have read them all 3-4 times.

            <h2>4 countries you should go to!!!</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been to quite a few different countries over the years, some I had alot of fun in whereas others were<br>
                    scary at times and dangerous. When traveling it is a great idea to checkout the neighborhood/area you are going<br>
                    to and not just the resort you are staying at. The resort could look very nice and pretty but when you adventure<br>
                    outside your resort it could be very dangerous and unwelcoming.<br>
